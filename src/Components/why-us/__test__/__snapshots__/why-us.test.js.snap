          <p>
            We are professional QA engineers who have an interest in training. All of us work full-time at

          <li>
             No spoonfeeding
          </li>
          <p>
            The tasks we assign to you will be very similar to what we do in the industry. You will be forced to think for yourself and solve real problems.
          </p>
          <li>
             Practical ... not theoretical 
          </li>
          <p>
            Unlike college and other training institutes, all your training is going to be hands-on. 
          </p>
          <li>
             No school like approach 
          </li>
          <p>
            You will recieve minimal guidance. Instead, you will learn by shadowing senior QA engineers and by working on real problems.
          </p>
          <li>
             No syllabus or book knowledge 
          </li>
          <p>
            The training will not work off a syllabus. We will not provide study materials. You need to do things and learn. 
          </p>
          <li>
             Real application 
          </li>
          <p>
            You will learn how software products are made in the industry by testing a real application.
